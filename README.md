# Routing-optimization-Travelling-Salesperson-Problem
Vehicle routing is a classic optimization problem in which the goal is to find the best routes for a fleet of vehicles visiting a set of locations.

The most famous routing problem is the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP): find the shortest route for a salesperson who needs to visit customers at different locations and return to the starting point. A TSP can be represented by a graph, in which the nodes correspond to the locations, and the edges (or arcs) denote direct travel between locations. The problem gets harder when there are more locations.
